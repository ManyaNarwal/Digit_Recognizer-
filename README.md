# Digit_Recognizer
This project was my introcution to Basics of Machine Learning. I undertook this project under the Women in Data Science Fall Projects. My work was among the final two projects presented in front of the Women in Data Scince executive members in Decmber 2022. I made a digit recognizer using K-Nearest neighbours alogorithum.
